Hello, my name is Nikolay Bachvarov. I am a senior in the American College of Sofia. I enjoy sports and some of my favorite ones are football and volleyball.

This year informatics we learned how to work with HTML and CSS. This portfolio is a result of my hardwork from this semester. I am eager to complete this assignment.
